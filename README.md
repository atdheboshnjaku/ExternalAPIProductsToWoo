# (In Progress: almost ready) External API Products To Woocommerce

External API Products To Woocommerce is a simple plugin that fetches products from the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and automatically creates/updates Woocommerce products using the Woocommerce API.

**Note** :  Needless to say, you will need to have WooCommerce installed, duh üòÅ 
![WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/themes/woo/images/logo-woocommerce.svg)

## Installation

```bash
Copy files into your wordpress plugins folder and install composer.
```

## Usage

Activate the plugin and give it a few seconds while it retrieves the fakestoreapi products and inserts them into woocommerce, it takes a bit longer because the images are also downloaded into your media library and applied to each product as a featured image.
